# raycast-scripts

A collection of scripts I use with [Raycast](https://raycast.com). Raycast lets you control your tools with a few keystrokes and installing script commands makes it possible to execute commands from anywhere on your desktop.

## Install Script Commands from this repository

To install commands from this repository, follow these steps:

1. Choose a script from the [repo](https://github.com/behrendco/raycast-scripts) and save it into a new directory.
2. Open the Extensions tab in the Raycast preferences
3. Click the plus button
4. Click `Add Script Directory`
5. Select directories containing your Script Commands

**ðŸ’¡ Hint:** It's recommended that you don't directly load the script directories into Raycast to avoid potential restructuring and new script commands suddenly appearing in Raycast.
